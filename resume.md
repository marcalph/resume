## Machine Learning Engineer,  8+ years of experience


&nbsp;

> Senior data scientist with a portfolio ranging from scoring to fraud detection, with experience in image recognition and language  modeling in agile and data driven environments. I'm looking for either a Tech Lead role in a team of Data Scientists or a senior Data Scientist position. About me : I am a product-oriented data nerd with a teamplayer mindset infused to the devops philosophy, my favorite perks in the job are the needed creativity and abstraction during model design and industrialization.  
> If any, my expertise revolves aroung Deep Learning in particular NLP and reinforcement learning. Also I love code, kaggle, coffee and comics (order may vary).

### ðŸ“ˆ Experience

#### CGI ðŸ§¢ Lead Data Scientist ðŸ“† 2018 - 2020

> Manage the AI lab agency while offering a window to our projects and skills Machine Learning wise. Define and build the data strategy of my clients.

##### MACIF :

* Macif NLP: *created models for all Macif's textual content (routing/classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis)- bumped up the performance from 85% over 3 classes to * **92% over 56 classes** > `Tensorflow, Huggingface, spacy, docker`
* Hub IA: *built the group's AI services platform, monitored and secure, as a swagger API catalog callable by every employee* > `WSGI, Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes`
* AutoML Workflow : *assembled an automatic AI retrain pipeline (similar to `MLFlow`) - Models are being automaticly retrained with new incoming data fed thanks to an users feedback loop (active learning, multitask-learning)* > `python, gitlab CI, Docker`
* RAD/LAD: *constructed a service for analyzing documents (classification & OCR) before storage* **95% over 80 classes** > `pytorch, Docker`
* MeetUps:  *defined the Data strategy at the departement level & AI evangelization for the whole company* `OKR, Gslides, Jupyter, Streamlit`
* Chatbot EPI: *redesinged the UX of the online member space (4.3 M users) - the deployment of AI models allowed to meet key objectives while modernizing the overall architecture* > `Tensorflow, spacy, rasa`


##### IMA (InterMutuelles Assistance) :

* Assist+: *PoC for a AI phone assistant - combined ASR/STT and various NLP models (NER, Classification, Semantic Similarity) to better the assistance process when facing car failures and accidents*;  
* Process : Speech transcription, vehicle identification, geolocalization, failure understanding from client's description, services (motor mechanic, taxi, hotel...) & SMS recap > `pytorch, Go, docker`

##### CGI - AI Lab :

* Project management & mentoring
* SOTA and technological monitoring
* Conferences, ELI5


#### MAIF ðŸ§¢ Data scientist ðŸ“† 2014 - 2018

> Bring to the various Departments funding the corresponding data projects the required expertise in statistical learning while conceiving the future tools to serve the MAIF members.

* Mail: *Automatic routing of e-mails & summarization, open sourced as* [MÃ©lusine](https://github.com/MAIF/melusine) *; design of neural architectures and extractives summarization algorithms* > `tensorfow, pySpark, scikit-learn, docker`
* MAIF & Go: *Claim pricing based on driving behaviours obtained by GPS trackers (IoT beacon & mobile app)* > `pySpark, R, caret`
* Valeur SociÃ©taire: * Modeling of expected rentability for customers on a large temporal horizon (LifeTime Value)* > `pySpark, Hadoop Map/Reduce`
